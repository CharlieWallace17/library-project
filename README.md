TOP Library Project

This project will highlight my ability to work with JavaScript constructor functions.

Primary features of this dynamic library catalogue include:

-Add new entries in real time.
-Delete entries in any order without creating empty indexes in the base array.
-Toggle read status on any entry, which will also update the underlying book object.
